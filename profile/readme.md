Nop Platform 2.0 is a new generation of low-code platform based on the theory of reversible computation. It is committed to overcoming the dilemma that low-code platform can not get rid of the exhaustive method, transcending the component technology from the theoretical level, and effectively solving the problem of coarse-grained software reuse.
